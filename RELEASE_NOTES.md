# Release Notes

## Changes in Splinter 0.3.11

### Highlights:
* Splinter supports dynamic multi-party circuit creation in scenarios where the
peers are not connected when the circuit proposal is submitted.
* A new scabbard CLI provides experimental subcommands to submit batches of
transactions to a scabbard service.
* New experimental endpoints have been added to get state from a scabbard
service.
* Information on how to run the Gameroom demo using Kubernetes is available in
[docker/kubernetes/README.md](https://github.com/Cargill/splinter/blob/master/docker/kubernetes/README.md).


### libsplinter:
- Enable more than two-party circuit connection. The admin service now waits
for all nodes in the circuit proposal to be peered before handling a consensus
proposal.
- Add Biome (user management) routes for fetching, listing and deleting users
and updating credentials.
- Establish connection to peers when handling votes. If the connection between
nodes is dropped after a proposal is submitted, a node will try to re-establish
the connection before submitting the vote.
- Add support to configure the timeout value for two-phase commit.
- Set the default timeout for admin and scabbard services to 30 seconds.
- Add experimental endpoints (behind the "scabbard-get-state" feature) for
fetching and listing entries in scabbard state.

### splinterd:
- Replace the current Config object with a PartialConfig and a
PartialConfigBuilder. This is the first part of significantly refactoring how
the Splinter daemon is configured.
- Fix the panic caused by unwrapping a bad protobuf message

### Gameroom:
- Add example files and instructions (in docker/kubernetes) on how to run the
Gameroom demo using Kubernetes.

### scabbard CLI:
- Add the scabbard CLI with experimental subcommands that closely resemble
those of the sabre CLI in Sawtooth Sabre.

### splinter CLI:
- Add a keygen subcommand to generate a user's public/private key pair. This
subcommand uses the "keygen" experimental feature.

### Packaging:
- Update the libsplinter Cargo.toml file to include only experimental and
stable in the list of features in package.metadata.docs.rs.
- Add the Gameroom CLI to the splinter-dev docker image.
- Publish Docker images built with experimental features during nightly cron
builds.

## Changes in Splinter 0.3.10

### libsplinter:
- Fix the wait for batch status in the ScabbardClient by adding the base URL if
  one is not provided.
- Add comments to ScabbardClient tests.

### splinterd:
- Add the CLI flag --enable-biome to the splinterd CLI.  The addition of this
  flag relaxes the requirement that the database-url option must be set.
  Currently, the database-url option is only required for the Biome subsystem.

### Gameroom:
- Add migrations for the Gameroom database to support upgrading an existing
  gameroom daemon.

### Gameroom CLI:
- Add gameroom CLI, which will initially be used to migrate the gameroom
  database.

## Changes in Splinter 0.3.9

### Highlights:
* A Splinter crate is now available at https://crates.io/crates/splinter.
* The "splinter" CLI has new experimental subcommands:
  - splinter circuit create (create a circuit)
  - splinter circuit vote (vote on a circuit)
  - splinter circuit list (display a list of circuits)
  - splinter circuit proposals (display a list of circuit proposals)
  - splinter circuit show (display circuit and proposal details)

### Deprecations and Breaking Changes:
* The new node registry format is enforced as of release 0.3.8. Each entry in
  the node registry must specify a node ID, a display name, and an endpoint.

### libsplinter:
* Add experimental list and fetch routes for circuit proposals to the admin
  service REST API.
* Add key management routes to the Biome REST API, including POST, GET and
  PATCH  to /biome/users/{user_id}/keys.
* Fix Scabbard initial events by rejecting an empty last_seen_event query
  parameter and properly handling empty transaction receipt stores.
* Add a newline to key files generated by the splinter CLI.
* Start initial implementation of ScabbardClient, which provides a convenient
  way to submit batches to a scabbard instance.

### splinterd
* Add experimental Biome users API routes to splinterd.
* Add experimental list and fetch routes for circuit proposals to the admin
  service REST API.
* Log a debug message instead of a warning when the splinterd config file is
  not found.
* Remove panics that can be caused by a user from Splinter daemon startup.
* Fix typos and standardize capitalization in splinterd help and error messages.

### splinter CLI
* Implement experimental "circuit create" subcommand.
* Implement experimental "circuit vote" subcommand.
* Add experimental "circuit list" and "circuit show" subcommands.
* Add "splinter circuit proposals" subcommand to list proposals.
* Add support for showing proposal details to "circuit list" subcommand.
* Change verbose and quiet flags to be global.

### Gameroom
* Add a docker-compose file that uses published images. This compose file can be
  used along with the repository in situations where building from scratch is
  not feasible.
* Update the Gameroom README with CARGO_ARGS instructions for running with
  experimental features.

### Packaging
* Update splinterd packaging for the current node registry format.
* Log current git HEAD commit hash during docker image builds.
* Add a description to the Cargo.toml files.

## Changes in Splinter 0.3.8

### Highlights:

* A new "experimental" feature set.  Features marked as experimental are
  available for use, but are subject to change.
* The “splinter-cli” command has been renamed to “splinter”.

### Deprecations and Breaking Changes:

* The Splinter CLI name has changed from “splinter-cli” to “splinter”.
  “splinter-cli” remains as an alias for “splinter”, but should be considered
  deprecated as of this release.
* The node registry trait was extensively updated to support iteration,
  implementation-agnostic filtering, and simplified modifications.

### Libsplinter:

* The protobuf files are now under the libsplinter subdirectory.  This enables
  publishing the "splinter" library crate.
* NodeRegistry::list_nodes now returns an iterator.
* NodeRegistry::update_node and add_node have been merged to
  NodeRegistry::insert.
* The REST API implementations for circuits, node registry, and key registry
  have moved from splinterd to libsplinter.
* A new "rest-api" stable feature includes the library functions mentioned
  above.
* New Biome features for user-related functionality such as credentials and key
  management. (Biome is the libsplinter module that supports user management.)
    - "biome"
    - "biome-credentials"
    - "biome-key-management"
    - "biome-notifications"
* A new "experimental" feature set that includes all experimental features.

## Changes in Splinter 0.3.7

### Highlights:
* The admin service and the scabbard service can now send catch-up events to
  bring new subscribers up to date

### Deprecations and Breaking Changes:
* The splinterd --generate-certs flag, which was deprecated in 0.3.6, is still
  available by default. In 0.3.8, the flag will not be available by default.
  Instead, you must use the Rust compile-time feature “generate-certs” to
  explicitly enable the deprecated --generate-certs flag. For more information,
  see the 0.3.6 release notes.
* In the next release, the splinter CLI name will change from “splinter-cli” to
  “splinter”. “splinter-cli” will exist as an alias for “splinter”, but should
  be considered deprecated as of release 0.3.8.

### libsplinter:
* Refactor the admin service and scabbard service to separate the REST API code
* Change admin service events to include a timestamp of when the event occurred
* Update the admin service to send all historical events that have occurred
  since a given timestamp when an app auth handler subscribes
* Update the scabbard event format to correlate directly with a transaction
  receipt
* Remove EventHistory from the REST API because it is no longer used
* Remove EventDealer from the REST API and replace it with the EventSender
* Update the event sender to send catch-up events as an asynchronous stream
* Add state-delta catch-up to the scabbard service, sending all events that
  occurred since a given event ID when a subscription request is received
* Update Network to properly clean up connections on disconnection

### splinterd:
* Fix the splinterd --heartbeat argument to properly accept a value

### Gameroom example:
* Update the gameroomd app auth handler to track the timestamp of the last-seen
  admin event
* Add the timestamp for the last-seen admin event to the app auth handler’s
  subscription request for getting any catch-up events
* Update the gameroom state-delta subscriber to track the ID of the last-seen
  scabbard event
* Add the ID of the last-seen scabbard event when subscribing to scabbard on
  restart, which lets the gameroom daemon receive catch-up events

### Private XO example:
* Replace the transact git repo dependency with a crates.io dependency

## Changes in Splinter 0.3.6

### Highlights:
* Peers can now successfully reconnect after restarting
* Faster build times:
  * Added a Dockerfile for splinter-dev docker image

  functionality that powers the Gameroom application; see
  examples/gameroom/README.md for a link to the PDF

### Deprecated Features:
* The --generate-certs flag for splinterd is now deprecated. Instead, please
  generate development certificates and keys using the new command "splinter-cli
  cert generate". This command will generate the certificates and keys in
  /etc/splinter/certs/ (by default) or in the specified directory.
  Note:  --generate-certs is still available by default in 0.3.6. It will be
  turned off in 0.3.7, but will still be available with a Rust compile-time
  feature flag. If using generated certificates, run splinterd with the
  --insecure flag.
